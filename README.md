# Introduction

React Native Date Picker.. Since RN seperate the IOS and Android picker and I need to merge it everytime when needed, I create this repo. I belive it might be useful for fellow programmers out there. Using pure RN components and everything is in one file. :)

## Usage

Copy the file and put it in your folder, then just use it by import it. DONE...

## Demo
